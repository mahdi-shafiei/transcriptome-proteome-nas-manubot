![**Comparing all dataset use in training vs. only target dataset use in training.**
Target dataset had an 80:20 trainining:validation split for all replicate calculations. 
In the justTargetDataset runs, no addiional changes were made. 
In the allDatasets runs, the training data was supplemented with all full non-target datasets.](images/sup_fig1_allVsTargetDatasetBoxplot.svg){#fig:allVsTargetDatasetBoxplot tag="6 - figure supplement 1" width="100%"}

![**Manually designed neural network architecture.**
Prior to Neural Architectural search optimization, 
a simple three-layer network with leaky relu activation functions was trained on the CPTAC datasets.](images/sup_fig2_manual_NN.svg){#fig:manual_NN tag="7 - figure supplement 2" width="100%"}

![**Comparison of four model types via 100x2 cross validation with full whisker coverage.**
A rendition of figure 1E, but with full whisker coverage.](images/sup_fig3_cross_model_comparison_full.svg){#fig:cross_model_comparison_full tag="8 - figure supplement 3" width="100%"}

![**Model interpretation evaluating transcript impact on specific protein predictions.**
SHAP analysis was performed for several of the most well-predicted proteins using all samples in the dataset. 
A kernel density graph (KDE) was plotted for mean absolute SHAP (y axis) versus spearman coefficient (x axis) for each transcriptâ€™s relation to 
(A) CAVIN1, 
(B) FERMT2, 
(C) FLNA, 
(D) HCLS1, 
(E) HK3, 
(F) MCM3, 
(G) MCM4, 
(H) MCM6, 
(I) MMP14, 
(J) P4HB, 
(K) PTPN6, 
(L) SMC2, 
(M) STAT1, 
and (N) VCL
